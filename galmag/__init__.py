GalMag - A Python tool for computing realistic galactic magnetic fields
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Generates realistic galactic magnetic field based on the dynamo equation

Example:
   Initializes a B_field object on a uniform cartesian 100x100x100 grid::

      from galmag import B_field

      box_limits = [[-15, 15],[-15, 15],[-15, 15]] # kpc
      box_resolution = [100,100,100]
      B = B_field(box_limits, box_resolution)


   Adds a disc magnetic field with reversals at 4.7 kpc and 12.25 kpc
   and a field strength of -3 microgauss close to the Sun::

      B.add_disk_field(reversals=[4.7,12.25] ,
                       B_phi_solar_radius=-3, # muG
                       number_of_modes=number_of_modes)


   Adds a halo magnetic field with intensity 0.1 microgauss close to the Sun::

      B.add_halo_field(halo_ref_Bphi=Bphi_sun)

   Each coordinate component of the produced magnetic can then be accessed
   through the relevant coordinate attributes, e.g.::

      B.r_spherical
      B.theta
